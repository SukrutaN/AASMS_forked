# Autonomous Altitude and Safety Management System for Hot Air Balloons

#### An embedded systems project by Sukruta Nadkarni and Alan J Bibins

## Components
The system is built around the Arduino Nano/Uno and integrates the following components:
- Altitude/Temp: BMP280/MS5611 Barometer.
- Positioning: Ublox NEO-6M GPS.
- Safety/IMU: MPU6050/BNO055 Inertial Sensor for tilt and turbulence.
- Communication: SX1278 LoRa for long-range telemetry.
- Control: MG996R Servo for burner valve regulation.

## Repo structure

```


## Project setup

We are using platformio for setting up and running the codebase, with wokwi to make the simulate the circuit

### wokwi-cli

We are going to use this run our code without the components (coz we don't have them rn)

Windows:
```powershell
iwr https://wokwi.com/ci/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

To run:
```powershell
wokwi-cli
```
You may be prompted to get a CI Token, go ahead and make that

### platformio-core (The cli for PlatformIO)

> [!NOTE]
> There is a vscode extension for platformio, I'd suggest using it. Perhaps if you use the extension you may not need the cli so try it out first before doing the following.

Windows:
```powershell
wget -O get-platformio.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio-core-installer/master/get-platformio.py
python3 get-platformio.py
```
